# Battleship
ENSE 351 project code, based on the class assingment. This code uses the fastNP library from Evil wombat to produce Battleship on 4 8x8 LED matrices.

This project was a submitted class project, and the repo does not have a proper .gitingore meaning files that do not need to be here are most likely here.

The library was also exported from the CubeIDE, an IDE that I have not used so I am unfamiler with any bloat that it may have caused and has not been removed.
